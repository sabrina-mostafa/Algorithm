# Depth First Search
•	When we only need to traverse a Graph, we use DFS.

•	We traverse a path from a Node like AS DEEP AS possible.



# Algorithm
1. Create a Boolien Array which will mark if a node is Visited or not.
2. Keep geting a node starting from the source node.
3. Mark it (selected node) visited and repeat 2 for all its adjacent UNVISITED nodes.
