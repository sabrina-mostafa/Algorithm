A Graph is represented as
      G(V,E)     here V = number of vertex/node
                      E = number of Edges
                       
Spanning Tree of G is :
      G'(V',E')  here, V' = V   i.e it will contain same number of verties as main Grapg
                          E' = (V-1) or subsets of E
