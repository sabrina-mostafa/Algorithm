A Graph is represented as
      G(V,E)     here V = number of vertex/node
                      E = number of Edges
                       
Spanning Tree of G is :
      G'(V',E')  here, V' = V   i.e it will contain same number of verties as main Grapg
                          E' = (V-1) or subsets of E
                          
A Spanning tree with least total cost is called Minimum Spanning Tree.
     It will never contain any Cicle.


There are two Algorithms for finding minimum Spaning Tree :
                                                         i. Kruskal's Algorithm
                                                        ii. Prim's Algorithm
