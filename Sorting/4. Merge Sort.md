# Merge Sort

## Complexity : 
       For whole Sorting = O( n Log(n) )
       Only for Merging = Theta( len of 1st sorted array + len of 2nd sorted array )

We will keep dividing the array in two parts Recursively untill it has only one element left. Then we will merge the divided sub-array/parts into a sorted list/array.


## Algorithm :

      1. Keep diving the array untill it has only 1 element :
            i. From Lower Bound to Mid
           ii. From mid+1 to Upper Bound 
           
      2. Merge each sub-array :
            i. Comapre the elements till the length of the smaller sub-array and preserve them in Sorted order
           ii. Preserve rest of the elements from the bigger sub-array
          iii. Simply copy all the elements from the preserved array to main array for that Particular Range Only
               (LowerBound to UpperBound)
